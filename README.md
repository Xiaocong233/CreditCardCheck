# CreditCardCheck_cs50x
This is my program wrote for CS50x Pset1 on edX in C. It checks an user input of a credit card number is valid or not and further evaluates it to the card's corresponding company or lack thereof.
The program incorporated mathematical calculation based on Luhnâ€™s Algorithm by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM.
Only 4 outputs are available: VISA, AMEX(American Express), MASTERCARD, and INVALID.
The code could definitely be condensed more efficiently using array, but currently I am not confident in the usage of it. I will get it eventually!
